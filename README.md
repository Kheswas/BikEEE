 #### About this project
 This is a python (pandas) backend application that parses an external .CSV file using pandas and sisplay the the 3 most frequently advertised models.
 
 A test case still needs to be completed for checking if models returned(printed are correct)
 
 If i had more time i would use regex to remove special characters from the database.
 
 ## next steps
 - create a resting API
 - learn how to test output data from csv files
 -  use regex to remove special characters and white spaces
